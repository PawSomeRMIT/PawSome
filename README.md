# COSC2657 - Android Development
# Pawsome application

Pawsome is an app that connects pet lovers with pet fosterers who have dogs, cats, and other adorable animals that are waiting for their forever homes. Users can book a pet for an hour or a day, enjoy the companionship of a cuddly creature and learn how to raise and live with a pet before coming to an adopted decision. Or simply having fun with a pet and going to a coffee shop with friends.

Pawsome is easy to use and has two types of accounts: customer and fosterer. As a customer, users are able to browse a list of available pets for booking, see their photos, profiles, and reviews. They can chat with the fosterer directly and ask any questions related to pets. Moreover, they can access booking history and rate experience with the pet and the agency. The fosterer account requires users to do an upgrade and its process involves a transaction API and fee. As the fosterer, users can post new pets for booking and edit their information. You can also chat with the customers and arrange the details of the booking.
